I mainly used hashcat to crack the passwords, with attack mode 0, which is the dictionary attack. I used modes 1000, 500, and 1800 accordingly with the file types. I tried this on many wordlists includeing rockyou, the words file from pasword generator project, and many others from the internet. Although I know of the existance of bigger wordlists that are very likely to include more passwords, I could not really use those because my laptop was breaking during the process, and getting very hot, sometimes it would turn of by itself, so I had to stop. Basically there is some lack of space resource here.
