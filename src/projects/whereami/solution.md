Answers:
1. What is the hidden artifact? It is the World's Largest Pysanka (Some websites suggest that it is actually the Second Largest)
2. Where is it located? Pysanka Avenue W, Vegreville, AB T9C 1L1, Canada
3. When was it put there? 1975
4. Why was it put there? The egg is representing a Ukrainian-style Easter egg. It is something of a mathematical landmark, its creation representing the first mathematical or geometric definition of an egg shape, and the first practical application of mathematical curve known as a “B-Spline.” The egg is tilted at a 30 degree angle and a strong wind turns the egg like a giant weather vane.

Approach:
i unzipped the secret.zip file using 7z. I then opend the produced file secret.png in a Hex Editor on Visual Studio Code. I read the first line which suggested that the file is actually a JFIF file rather than PNG File. I looked for a JFIF file opener, and found one: https://filext.com/file-extension/JFIF. This showed File Metadate, which includes latitude and longitude information. I used a GPS coordinates tool: https://www.gps-coordinates.net, and found the exact location of the artifact: 
World's Largest Pysanka, Pysanka Avenue W, Vegreville, AB T9C 1L1, Canada
Latitude: 53.49185 | Longitude: -112.035981.
